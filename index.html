        <h1>Haoran (Alex) Yu</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my personal website! (Currently under construction)</p>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Welcome. I am Haoran Yu, a dedicated researcher and data science professional with a robust academic foundation. I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics at the University of Toronto, complemented by minors in Statistics and Economics. My academic journey has been characterized by rigorous coursework that spans both theoretical and applied disciplines. I have engaged deeply with subjects such as Probability and Statistics, Financial Economics, Methods of Data Analysis, and Statistical Machine Learning, which have provided me with a comprehensive understanding of data-centric methodologies. In addition, courses in Linear Algebra, Advanced Calculus, Abstract Mathematics, Complex Variables, Mathematical Modelling, Nonlinear Optimization, and Mathematical Theory of Finance have honed my analytical and problem-solving capabilities.</p>
        <p>This diverse academic training has been instrumental in informing my research and professional projects. I have applied my theoretical knowledge to practical challenges, such as developing machine learning models for loan default prediction, designing anti-fraud analytical frameworks, and conducting regression analyses on insurance premium data. My role as a Real Estate Investment Expansion Intern Analyst further enriched my experience, allowing me to integrate quantitative methods with strategic market research and financial analysis.</p>
        <p>I am proficient in a range of analytical tools and programming languages, including Python (with libraries such as NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, PyTorch, and SciPy), R, SAS, and SQL. I invite you to explore my website to learn more about my research contributions, project experiences, and professional achievements.</p>
